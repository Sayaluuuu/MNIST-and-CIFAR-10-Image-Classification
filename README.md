# MNIST-and-CIFAR-10-Image-Classification
This project demonstrates deep learning-based image classification using two widely-used benchmark datasets: MNIST (handwritten digits) and CIFAR-10 (colored object images). Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) built with TensorFlow/Keras, the models are trained to accurately recognize visual patterns across grayscale and RGB images. The MNIST model achieves high accuracy, showcasing the strength of CNNs in digit recognition, while the CIFAR-10 model handles more complex, real-world image categories. This project also includes preprocessing steps, model evaluation metrics, and visualization of predictions, making it a strong foundation for understanding computer vision tasks in modern AI workflows.
